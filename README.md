# Multi-ClipBoard

Clipboard is when you copy and paste stuff. and you only have access to only one sentence, wich is the last one you copied. and then when you copy somthing else you'r going to overwrite what you already have.

with Multi-Clipboard you will be able to store multiple things in your Clipboard, and then call any time you want. So you can save passwords, emails any thing you want and call them any time you want.

so open your terminal and go to the file (cd file_path )

to save the current clipboard :

python MultiClipboard.py save        or       python MultiClipboard.py s         and then it well ask you to enter a key for the clipboard to be saved




to load a previous clipboard :

python MultiClipboard.py load        or       python MultiClipboard.py l    and then it well ask you to enter the key of the clipboard


to show all the clipboards you have saved:

python MultiClipboard.py list        or       python MultiClipboard.py ls




AS SIMPLE AS THAT ;)
